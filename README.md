# Urban Routes – Sprint 2: Test Design

This project is part of the Urban Routes regression testing cycle, with a focus on **Sprint 2 – Manual Test Design**, specifically for the **"Add Driver’s License"** form field validation.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To validate the input behavior and constraints of the **Name** field based on:

- Equivalence classes
- Boundary values
- Accepted and rejected characters
- Error messages and input acceptance

---

## 📁 Project Structure

This repository includes manually designed test cases and test data documentation, accessible via a shared Google Sheet:

### ✅ Equivalence Classes & Boundary Values

Test matrix includes:

- Valid input ranges (2 to 14 characters)
- Boundary value testing (e.g., 1, 2, 14, 15+ characters)
- Input variations including:
  - Latin and non-Latin letters
  - Spaces (beginning, middle, end)
  - Special characters, numbers, and hyphens
  - Empty field scenarios

### 🧪 Manual Test Cases

Each test case includes:

- Unique Test ID
- Clear and realistic scenario title
- Preconditions and setup
- Step-by-step instructions
- Expected system behavior
- Validation of field restrictions and error handling
